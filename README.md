Below are some projects developed with Java Android during the [Entra21 Program](https://www.entra21.com.br/) in 2022.<br>
All of them were coded by [me](https://github.com/bruno-g-pellis) using Android Studio (Integrated Development Environment - IDE) when I was studying in the Program.<br> Some projects were developed based on video lessons on YouTube.
